## What are the dotted and dashed lines under variable names?

These are **scope indicators**: **global variables** are marked with solid underlines,
**local variables** are maked with dotted underlines,
local variables that shadow other local variables in the same scope are marked with dashed underlines,
and those local variables that are shadowed by other local variables are striken out.
For example, in `local foo = 1; local foo = 2`, first `foo` variable will be striken out as it's shadowed by the second `foo` instance and the second `foo` variable will be marked with dashed underline.

You can [change their types, colors, or disable them](doc-styles-color-schemes#indicators).

## How to specify a directory my script should be executed in for `require` commands to work?

You can set the [project directory](doc-getting-started#project-directory), which will be used to set the current directory when your application is run or debugged.

## Why stepping into function calls doesn't work in some cases?

You need to have a file opened in the IDE before you can step into functions defined in that file.
You can also configure the IDE to [auto-open files](https://github.com/pkulchenko/ZeroBraneStudio/blob/master/cfg/user-sample.lua#L71) for you.

## How to refresh the files shown in the Project tree after the changes made outside of the IDE?

(**v1.40+**) All the changes in the file system will be reflected in the Project tree when they happen in the folders expanded in the tree.
You can still refresh the Project tree content manually when it gets out of sync by using `Refresh` item in the Project tree local menu (activated with right click on an item).
If you are using one of the earlier versions, you can check [Refresh Project](https://github.com/pkulchenko/ZeroBranePackage/blob/master/refreshproject.lua) plugin (Windows only).

## Why do I get a warning about attempt to connect to port 8172 when I start debugging?

The IDE is using port 8172 to communicate with the application being debugged.
If you get a firewall warning, you need to **allow the connection** for the debugging to work properly.

## Why am I getting "could not connect to ...:8172" message?

This may happen for several reasons:

- You start your application that uses `require('mobdebug').start()` call to connect to the IDE, but the **debugger server is not started** in the IDE.
You can fix this by selecting `Project | Start Debugger Server`; if it is disabled, the server is already started.
- Your **firewall is configured to block connection** to port 8172, which is used by the IDE to communicate with the application you are debugging.
You need to allow this connection for the debugging to work.
- In rare cases the IDE may **incorrectly detect the hostname** of the computer it runs on, which may prevent the debugging from working.
The **hostname is shown** in the Output window when the debugging is started: `Debugger server started at <hostname>:<port>`.
You can use a different hostname by setting `debugger.hostname` value in the [configuration file](doc-general-preferences#debugger).
For example, if the default hostname is incorrect, **try setting it to `localhost`** by using `debugger.hostname = "localhost"`.
- You may be **on VPN**, which may **block connections** or cause the IDE to **incorrectly detect the hostname**.
You may configure `debugger.hostname` as described above to see if this resolves the issue.

## Why breakpoints are not triggered?

Breakpoints set in source files may not work for several reasons:

- A breakpoint may be **inside a coroutine**; by default breakpoints inside coroutines are not triggered.
To enable debugging in coroutines, including triggering of breakpoints, you may either
(1) add `require('mobdebug').on()` call to that coroutine, which will enable debugging for that particular coroutine, or
(2) add `require('mobdebug').coro()` call to your script, which will enable debugging for all coroutines created using `coroutine.create` later in the script.
- If you enable coroutine debugging using `require('mobdebug').coro()`, this will **not affect coroutines created using C API** or Lua code wrapped into `coroutine.wrap`.
You can still debug those fragments after adding `require('mobdebug').on()` to the coroutine code. 
- The path of the file known to the IDE **may not be the same** as the path known to the Lua engine.
For example, if you use an embedded engine, you may want to check if the path reported by the engine is normalized (doesn't include `../` references) by checking the result of `debug.getinfo(1,"S").source`.
- The capitalization of the file known to the IDE **may not be the same** as the capitalization of the file known to the Lua engine with the latter running on a case-sensitive system.
For example, if you set a breakpoint on the file `TEST.lua` in the IDE running on Window (case-insensitive), it may not fire in the application running `test.lua` on Linux (with case-sensitive file system).
To avoid this make sure that the capitalization for your project files is the same on both file systems.
- The script you are debugging may **change the current folder** (for example, using `lfs` module) and load the script (using `dofile`) from the changed folder.
To make breakpoints work in this case you may want to **use absolute path** with `dofile`.
- You may have a symlink in your path and be referencing paths to your scripts differently in the code and in the IDE (using a path with symlink in one case and not using it in the other case).
- You may be using your own Lua engine that doesn't report file names relative to the project directory (as set in the IDE).
For example, you set the project directory pointing to `scripts` folder (with `common` subfolder) and the engine reports the file name as `myfile.lua` instead of `common/myfile.lua`;
the IDE will be looking for `scripts/myfile.lua` instead of `scripts/common/myfile.lua` and the file will not be activated and the breakpoints won't work.
You may also be using inconsistent path separators in the file names; for example, `common/myfile.lua` in one case and `common\myfile.lua` in another.
- If you are loading files using `luaL_loadbuffer`, make sure that the chunk name specified (the last parameter) matches the file location.
- If you set/remove breakpoints while the application is running, these changes may not have any effect if only a small number of Lua commands get executed.
To limit the negative impact of socket checks for pending messages, the debugger in the application only checks for incoming requests every 200 statements (by default), so if your tests include fewer statements, then `pause`/`break` commands and toggling breakpoints without suspending the application may not work.
To make the debugger to check more frequently, you can update `checkcount` field (`require('mobdebug').checkcount = 1`) before or after debugging is started.
- If breakpoints are still not working, you may want to enable verbose debugging (`debugger.verbose=true`) as this will provide additional information about paths reported by the interpreter and used by the IDE.

## Why stepping into coroutines doesn't work?

See [this section](doc-lua-debugging#coroutine-debugging) in the documentation for details on how to enable it.

## Is it possible to debug dynamic fragments loaded with `loadstring()`?

Yes; **starting from v0.38** if you step into `loadstring()` call, the IDE will open a new window (when [editor.autoactivate](https://github.com/pkulchenko/ZeroBraneStudio/blob/master/cfg/user-sample.lua#L71) is enabled) with the code you can then step through.
As an alternative, you can specify a filename as the second parameter to `loadstring` (also as the absolute or relative path) and have that file in your project directory with the same content as what's loaded with `loadstring`.

You can then open that file in the IDE or configure it to [auto-open](https://github.com/pkulchenko/ZeroBraneStudio/blob/master/cfg/user-sample.lua#L71) it for you.

There is one caveat with debugging of fragments loaded with `loadstring`: one-line code fragments will be interpreted as filenames.
To make them recognized as the code fragment, just add a new line or make it more than one line long.

## Is debugging of Lua 5.2 applications supported?

Yes; see [Lua 5.2 debugging](doc-lua52-debugging) section for details.

## Is debugging of Lua 5.3 applications supported?

Yes; see [Lua 5.3 debugging](doc-lua53-debugging) section for details.

## Is debugging of Lua 5.4 applications supported?

Yes; see [Lua 5.4 debugging](doc-lua54-debugging) section for details.

## Is debugging of LuaJIT applications supported?

**Starting from v0.35** the debugging of LuaJIT applications is supported out-of-the-box.
See [LuaJIT debugging](doc-luajit-debugging) section for details.

## Is debugging of 64bit applications supported?

Yes; even when you use a 32bit version of the IDE, you can still run and debug 64bit applications.
See [Debugging of 64bit applications](doc-remote-debugging#debugging-of-64bit-applications) section for details.

## Why am I getting compilation errors in the IDE when my code runs fine outside of it?

**Starting from v0.39**, ZeroBrane Studio is using LuaJIT as its internal Lua engine.
LuaJIT is a bit more strict than Lua 5.1 in some checks and may return errors even when your application runs fine by Lua 5.1.
One typical example is string escape sequences. Lua 5.1 lists [escape sequences it recognizes](http://www.lua.org/pil/2.4.html), but it will accept other sequences as well, for example, `\/`.
Running a script with this escape sequence under LuaJIT will trigger an error: `invalid escape sequence near ...`.

The solution in this case is to **"fix" the escape sequence** and replace `\/` with `/`, which will have the same effect in Lua 5.1, LuaJIT, and Lua 5.2.

## How to open file and position cursor to a specific line or position in the file?

When launching the IDE and passing a filename as a parameter, it's possible to include the line number (using `filename:<line>`) and position (using `filename:p<pos>`) in the file.
After the file is opened, the cursor will be moved to the specified position or the beginning of the specified line.

## How to search or replace with regular expressions?

To **search or replace using regular expressions**, you can toggle `Regular expression` icon on the search panel toolbar.
These regular expressions do not accept Lua character classes that start with `%` (like `%s`, `%d`, and others), but accept `.` (as any character), char-sets (`[]` and `[^]`), modifiers `+` and `*`, and characters `^` and `$` to match beginning and end of the string.
Regular expressions only match within a single line (not over multiple lines).
See [Scintilla documentation](http://www.scintilla.org/ScintillaDoc.html#SCI_GETTAG) for details on what special characters are accepted.

## How to replace using captures in regular expressions?

(**v0.39+**) When regular expression search is used with search and replace, `\n` refer to first through ninth **pattern captures** marked with brackets `()`.
For example, when searching for `MyVariable([1-9])` and replacing with `MyOtherVariable\1`, `MyVariable1` will be replaced with `MyOtherVariable1`, `MyVariable2` with `MyOtherVariable2`, and so on.

## Why is the text blurry when running on Windows 8?

(**v1.10 and earlier**) Right-click on ZeroBrane Studio icon -> `Properties` -> `Compatibility` -> `"Disable display scaling on high DPI settings"`.
See the link in [this ticket](https://github.com/pkulchenko/ZeroBraneStudio/issues/210) for alternative solutions if this doesn't work.

(**v1.11+**) If you are using v1.11 or later, this is no longer be needed as the IDE launcher (`zbstudio.exe`) enables dpi awareness by default.

(**v1.40+**) HiDPI awareness has also been enabled for Lua executables for all supported versions.
You may still need to enable it for other executables (not included with the IDE) as needed to make the applications you start from the IDE dpi-aware as well.

## Why is the text blurry in the editor when running on retina display (macOS)?

(**v0.50 and earlier**) You can set `hidpi = true` in [configuration settings](doc-configuration); this setting is enabled by default on macOS **starting from v0.60**.

(**v1.30 and earlier**) Note that using this setting negatively affects [indicators](doc-styles-color-schemes#indicators) that have alpha property (the indicators are not shown when this setting is enabled).

## How to change background color in the editor?

You can specify `styles.text.bg = {240,240,240}` in [configuration settings](doc-configuration).
See the [example](https://github.com/pkulchenko/ZeroBraneStudio/blob/master/cfg/user-sample.lua).
To modify colors and appearance of IDE elements, check [documentation on styles and color schemes](doc-styles-color-schemes).

## How to change the color scheme in the editor?

You can open `cfg/scheme-picker.lua` in the IDE and click on links with color scheme names to test included schemes.
These schemes can be configured as shown in [user-sample.lua](https://github.com/pkulchenko/ZeroBraneStudio/blob/master/cfg/user-sample.lua#L83-L88).

For more information on how to modify colors and appearance of IDE elements, check [documentation on styles and color schemes](doc-styles-color-schemes).

## How to accept keyboard input for applications started from the IDE?

(**v1.20 and earlier**) You need to output something using `print` or `io.write` before reading input.
You will see a prompt in the Output window where you can enter your input.

If you launch the application outside of the IDE, make sure you **flush the printed output** (or use `io.stdout:setvbuf('no')`) before accepting the input.

## Why don't I see `print` output immediately in the Output window?

Lua (and some engines based on it, like LÖVE) has output buffered by default,
so if you only `print` a small number of bytes, you may see the results only after the script is completed.

If you want to see the `print` output immediately, **add `io.stdout:setvbuf("no")` to your script**, which will turn the buffering off.
There may be a small performance penalty as the output will be flushed after each `print`, so keep that in mind.

## How to pass command line arguments?

This is described in the [command line parameters](doc-general-preferences#command-line-parameters) section.

## Where is the configuration file stored?

This is covered in the description of system [configuration](doc-configuration).

## How can I modify a key mapping?

To modify a key mapping for a particular menu item, see the [key mapping](doc-general-preferences#key-mapping) section.
You may also review [xcode-keys](https://github.com/pkulchenko/ZeroBraneStudio/blob/master/cfg/xcode-keys.lua) configuration file that can be used to modify keyboard shortcuts to match those in XCode.

## Why am I getting a warning about "invalid UTF8 character" in the files I open in the editor?

(**v1.30 and earlier**) You probably have files created using one of Microsoft [Windows code pages](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_code_page#List); most likely 1252, 936, or 950.
ZeroBrane Studio is using [UTF-8 encoding](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8), which allows users to use any supported language, but the files need to use Unicode encodings.
If you want to continue editing this file in the IDE, you have two choices:

1. Ignore the warning and **change `[SYN]` characters** to whatever text you need *inside ZeroBrane Studio*.
2. **Convert your files** from the encoding you are using to UTF-8 (65001) and then load them into the IDE.

## How do I run multiple instances of ZeroBrane Studio?

You can start multiple instances if you disable "single instance" check
either by adding `singleinstance=false` to the configuration file
or by starting the second instance with the following command: `zbstudio -cfg "singleinstance=false"`.

The single instance check is disabled on macOS by default; to run multiple instances, you need to use `open -n ZeroBraneStudio.app`.

## How do I start two ZeroBrane Studio instances to debug two applications at the same time?

You can start one instance as you normally do and then start the second instance using the following command: `zbstudio -cfg "singleinstance=false; debugger.port = 8173"`.
This command disables a singleinstance check for the second instance and configures it to use port 8173 for debugging.
You can then use `require('mobdebug').start("domain-name", 8173)` in your application to connect to the second instance for debugging.

If you use macOS, you may need to run the command as `open -n ZeroBraneStudio.app --args -cfg "debugger.port = 8173"`.

## How do I restore default configuration for UI elements?

If you made changes by moving panels/windows around and want to undo them,
you can **restore** the original UI configuration by selecting `View | Default Layout`.

## How do I merge or split windows and tabs?

To merge or split windows and tabs and to change their positions, check the [section in the Tips and Tricks document](doc-tips-and-tricks#merge-and-split-windows-and-tabs).

## How do I restore default configuration for recent files, projects, and editor tabs?

You can **remove** the [configuration file](doc-general-preferences#session-configuration) ZeroBrane Studio is using to store these settings.

## Why can't I delete text that includes formatted comments?

(This restriction has been **removed in v1.20**) Formatted comments allow usage of [Markdown formatting](doc-markdown-formatting), which uses styles with hidden characters.
Those characters can't be deleted with some of the delete operations (line 'cut' or 'delete selection') and need to be deleted using `Delete` or `Backspace`.

## I'm getting a message about mixed end-of-line sequences. How do I make them visible?

You may run `GetEditor():SetViewEOL(1)` in the local console; you will see end-of-line sequences marked as `CR`, `LF`, or `CRLF`.
Re-open the document or run `GetEditor():SetViewEOL(0)` to disable showing end-of-line sequences.

## How to make the current line more visible during debugging?

You can try changing the current line marker to something more visible, like underline by adding the following code to the configuration file: `styles.marker.currentline.ch = wxstc.wxSTC_MARK_UNDERLINE`.
You can also change the color and the type of the marker: `styles.marker.currentline = {ch = wxstc.wxSTC_MARK_UNDERLINE, bg = {0, 0, 255}}` (this will set the background to `blue`).

## Where do I find the list of functions in the current file?

(**v0.90+**) The list of functions is shown in the Outline tab located next to the Project tab.
The content of the Outline can be [configured in various ways](doc-general-preferences#outline).

(**v0.80 and earlier**) The list of functions was available through the dropdown in the toolbar.

## How to set the edge in the editor at a particular column?

(**v1.61+**) You can set `editor.edge = true` or `editor.edge = 76` to mark the edge at a specific column (80 is the default).
See [editor settings](doc-editor-preferences#editor) for details.

With earlier versions you can use the [edgemark plugin](https://github.com/pkulchenko/ZeroBranePackage/blob/master/edgemark.lua).

## Why not all upvalues are shown in the debugger?

Upvalues shown in watch/console/stack windows will only include those **upvalues that are used or referenced** in the current function.
For example, if you step into function `abc` from the following fragment -- `local a, b = 1, 2; function abc() print(a) end` -- then only `a` variable will be listed as the upvalue.
If you try to access the value of `b` in the Watch or the Console window, you'll get `nil` as that **upvalue is not present in the scope** of that function.

## Why am I getting `mach-o, but wrong architecture` error on macOS?

You may be trying to load a 64bit module using Lua executable that is included with the IDE.
Since the Lua executable is 32bit, you get the error about incompatible architectures.

To avoid this issue you need to configure the IDE to use your own 64bit Lua executable by setting `path.lua = '/full/path/lua-executable'` in the configuration.

Note that you can still use the IDE to debug your applications as the luasocket library required for debugging is compiled as universal binary and can be loaded into both 32bit and 64bit applications.

## How do I select a main file to use with `Run` or `Debug` commands?

By default the execution of the project starts with the file in the current editor tab (at least with the default Lua interpreters).
If you want to start the execution from a different file, you may set it using the following steps:

1. Select the file in the [Project panel](doc-getting-started#project-directory),
2. Open popup menu using mouse right-click, and
3. Select `Set As Start File`.

This will set the selected file as the start file; the file will have a different icon to help distinguish it from other files.
You can later change it to a different file or unset by selecting `Unset .... As Start File` from the same menu.

## How do I show Corona SDK Console window on Windows?

(**v0.81+**) You may set `corona = {showconsole = true}` in [system or user configuration](doc-configuration). See [all Corona-specific preferences](doc-corona-preferences) for details.

(**v0.80 and earlier**) You may add the following line to [system or user configuration](doc-configuration): `unhidewindow.ConsoleWindowClass = 0`.
