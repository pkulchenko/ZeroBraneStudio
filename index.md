ZeroBrane Studio is a **lightweight Lua IDE** with code completion, syntax
highlighting, remote debugger, code analyzer, live coding, and debugging
support for several Lua engines ([LuaJIT](http://luajit.org/),
[Löve 2D](http://love2d.org/), [Moai](http://getmoai.com/), [Gideros](http://http://giderosmobile.com/),
[MobileLua](https://github.com/divineprog/mobilelua), and others).

It is **simple and instantly usable** for beginners (as tested with middle and
high school students with no programming experience), yet
[feature-rich](features.html) and extensible for experienced developers.
Unlike Eclipse and IntelliJ it has a **small footprint and is completely
customizable with Lua**. Unlike TextMate and Sublime Text 2 it includes a
**remote debugger** and a **full IDE feature set**.

ZeroBrane Studio also provides several unique features: **live coding** for
immediate feedback, **Markdown formatting** in comments for providing
instructions with minimal context switching, and **integrated interactive
materials** for those learning Lua or getting familiar with programming.

For those interested in **game development**, it supports debugging and
auto-complete for [Löve 2D](http://love2d.org/). For those interested in 
**mobile development**, it integrates with [Moai](http://getmoai.com/) to
debug Moai applications.

## Feature highlights

* Small, portable, open-source, and cross-platform ([Windows](images/debugging.png), [Mac OSX](images/autocomplete-osx.png), and [Linux](images/scratchpad-linux-mint.png)).
* Auto-completion for functions, keywords, and custom APIs.
* Interactive console to directly test code snippets with local and remote execution.
* Integrated debugger (with support for local and remote debugging).
* Live coding with Lua, Löve 2D, and Gideros.
