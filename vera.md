_ZeroBrane Studio for Vera_ is a **lightweight Lua IDE**
with **debugging support for [Vera](http://getvera.com/)**
home automation devices (also known as MiCasaVerde and MCV).

It is **[simple](vera-getting-started.html) and instantly usable** for beginners,
yet **[feature-rich](vera-features.html) and extensible** for experienced developers.
The IDE provides a **powerful editor** with code completion and syntax highlighting,
a **code analyzer** helpful in finding typos and subtle errors,
and **advanced debugger** that support debugging of Lua **scripts and events** in applications running on Vera devices.

Using the debugger, you can **set/remove breakpoints**,
**step through the code**,
**run Lua commands** and **update variables** in the Remote Console,
**view the call stack** using the Stack window,
**inspect variables** using tooltips and the Watch window,
and **upload files** to the device.

To save you time, _ZeroBrane Studio for Vera_ shows you the **results of `print` commands** during debugging, which minimizes the use of device log files.
If you still want to see the log content, it provides a convenient option to **download the log file** into a new editor window right in the IDE.
