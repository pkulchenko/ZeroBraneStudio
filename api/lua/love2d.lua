The highdpi window flag must be enabled to use the full pixel density of a Retina screen on Mac OS X and iOS. The flag currently does nothing on Windows and Linux, and on Android it is effectively always enabled.\n\nMost LÃ–VE functions return values and expect arguments in terms of pixels rather than density-independent units.",
