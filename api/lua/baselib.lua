The function can return another function (the module loader) plus an extra value that will be passed to that loader, or a string explaining why it did not find that module (or nil if it has nothing to say).\n\nLua initializes this table with four searcher functions.\n\nThe first searcher simply looks for a loader in the package.preload table.\n\nThe second searcher looks for a loader as a Lua library, using the path stored at package.path. The search is done as described in function package.searchpath.\n\nThe third searcher looks for a loader as a C library, using the path given by the variable package.cpath. Again, the search is done as described in function package.searchpath. Once it finds a C library, this searcher first uses a dynamic link facility to link the application with the library. Then it tries to find a C function inside the library to be used as the loader. The name of this C function is the string \"luaopen_\" concatenated with a copy of the module name where each dot is replaced by an underscore. Moreover, if the module name has a hyphen, its prefix up to (and including) the first hyphen is removed.\n\nThe fourth searcher tries an all-in-one loader. It searches the C path for a library for the root name of the given module. If found, it looks into it for an open function for the submodule. With this facility, a package can pack several C submodules into one single library, with each submodule keeping its original open function.\n\nAll searchers except the first one (preload) return as the extra value the file name where the module was found, as returned by package.searchpath.
