  <summary>Lightweight Lua-based IDE for Lua</summary>
  <description>
    <p>
      ZeroBrane Studio is a lightweight Lua IDE with code completion, syntax 
      highlighting, live coding, code analyzer, and debugging support for
      Lua 5.1, Lua 5.2, Lua 5.3, LuaJIT, and other Lua engines.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is simple and instantly usable for beginners yet feature-rich and
      extensible for experienced developers. It has a small footprint and is
      completely customizable with Lua while still including a full IDE feature
      set including a remote debugger.
