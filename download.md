- Improved handling of valid and invalid UTF8 strings in copy/paste operations.
- Updated Corona API for v2017.3068.
- Fixed showing and copying invalid UTF-8 values in the Watch window.

Full details are in the [changelog](https://github.com/pkulchenko/ZeroBraneStudio/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).

## Upgrade warnings.

If you are using **MacOS**, make sure to **save your ZeroBrane Studio system settings** (`Edit | Preferences | Settings: System`) before upgrading as those are saved inside the application folder and **will be lost** during the upgrade.
As an alternative, you can **move those system settings to user settings** (`Edit | Preferences | Settings: User`) as those are not affected by the upgrade process.

If you are using **Windows or Linux**, made any modifications to the files in the distribution,
and plan to install the upgrade into the same location, make sure to **save your changes** before proceeding.
